# Tearing Down and Mocking Up Facebook with Balsamiq
This is the final project for the Web Design Basics course of Viking Code Schoolâ€™s prep work. The project involved doing a UX teardown of Facebook, followed by a design teardown of five of the main pages (home page when logged out, newsfeed when logged in, profile page, about page, and photos page), and, finally, a mockup of the same five pages.

The files in this repo include:
* An open document text (.odt) file containing the explaination of the UX teardown, the design teardown, and the mockups
* A PDF file containing images of all five of the mockups created in Balsamiq
* 7 PNG files of the same 5 mockups and the information architecture and flow charts for the site.
